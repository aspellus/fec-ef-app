## Usability Testing

Typically, we will select at least 5 people from the target audience, in this prototype project we selected 2 people to conduct our Usability test.

### Identify, target audience
Person #1 (Neal Smith) was knowledgeable on FEC Election filings process, and Person #2 (John Edgar) was totally new to FEC Election Filing process.

### Created Tasks and Allocate fixed time.
Tasks were defined to achieve the most common user goals

Example tasks:
1.	Go the portal URL and login to the web portal 
2.	Can logout of the portal successfully
3.	Select a listing to View/Amend successfully 
4.	Change a transaction in the receipts listing successfully
5.	Delete a transaction in the receipts listing successfully
6.	Add a transaction in the receipts listing successfully
We asked both users to perform this testing in allotted time of 15 minutes.

### Usability Testing
We could read the same test instruction with the 2 users and observe how they conduct themselves and if they are able to finish the task.

### Result Analysis and feedback to team
Since this was a prototype project, we had open discussion on the finding 
-	How much time it took both to conduct each task
-	What was source of confusion 
-	Was the interface intuitive 
-	Also noted facial expression

After analysis the usability issues were discussed and priortized. Some of the feeback was:
1. Add more messaging on Home Page, Portal Page and Amend Page to let users know where they are and what they can do.
2. Add messaging to functionality buttons like "Submit to FEC", to make it clear what the click on the button will do.
3. Adding, deleting is too fast for users to see it, messaging that will stay and clear on click action or popup to be used.
4. Android responsive design looks good, on iphone we need to do more testing.

The feedback along with other issues were added to product backlog for priortization by product owner for future sprints. We plan to conduct similar usability testing with target users as an when a new feature is released.
