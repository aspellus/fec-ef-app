## Usability Testing

Typically, we will select at least 5 people from the target audience, in this prototype project we selected 2 people to conduct our Usability test.

### Identify, target audience
Person #1 (Neal Smith) was knowledgeable on FEC Election filings process, and Person #2 (John Edgar) was totally new to FEC Election Filing process.

### Created Tasks and Allocate fixed time.
Tasks were defined to achieve the most common user goals

Example tasks:
1.	Go the portal URL and login to the web portal 
2.	Can logout of the portal successfully
3.	Select a listing to View/Amend successfully 
4.	Change a transaction in the receipts listing successfully
5.	Delete a transaction in the receipts listing successfully
6.	Add a transaction in the receipts listing successfully
We asked both users to perform this testing in allotted time of 15 minutes.

### Usability Testing
We could read the same test instruction with the 2 users and observe how they conduct themselves and if they are able to finish the task.

### Result Analysis and feedback to team
Since this was a prototype project, we had open discussion on the finding 
-	How much time it took both to conduct each task
-	What was source of confusion 
-	Was the interface intuitive 
-	Also noted facial expression

After analysis the usability issues were added to backlog for further prioritization working with product owner
